- This code is so simple it is self-explanatory.
- It works, but it's primitive, improve it if you may. 

(It doesn't actually work NOW, only works for 'test...' contacts, as the policy will not be applied until Sep 2018 or so)
- Feel free to create pull request or raise issues.

I'll change the code when the time comes.

1. Sync contacts from your phone to Google contact.
2. Backup contacts.

    You should know how to do steps 1 and 2; otherwise, if you are close to me, just pm me; else, ask someone/Google.

3. ~~Create a new google script project.~~
    1. ~~Go to https://script.google.com/, click 'New script' (or something like that)~~
    2. ~~Add code.gs to the project~~
3. Go to this https://goo.gl/HHeuod
4. Click the super familiar triangle shape button to run the only function.

    You should be prompted for permission to manage your contact, and if you trust me (well, you should), just approve the permission.
5. Re-check and sync your Google contact to your phone.
